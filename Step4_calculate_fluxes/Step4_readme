This code calculates the number flux of each sinking particle category.  
Input csv file is generated from Step 3, the particle data file concatinated from multiple magnifications and with assigned particle IDs.
This code will save graphs the visualize the number fluxes calculated from each magnification, so you can sanity check whether optimal size ranges were used in each magnification
A csv file is saved with flux data including all particle types.

Example usage in shell:
> Calculate fluxes.py [input csv] [sample name] [time] [output directory]

Time is the deployment time of the trap, used to calculte flux.
The code is almost identical among cruises, but needed to be modified slightly due to different image resolution and dimensions due to camera used.
Also, used different magnifications depending on the cruise, so combined fluxes across magnifications differently.
RR55 and RR56 samples collected during EXPORTS had a separete size range of optimal magnifications used, because these samples were left out at sea for a long duation due to instrument error before recovery.  The resulting samples were relatively degraded due to the extended deployment, so some particles became more obscured at certain magnifications in a way that did not occur in fresh samples that did not contain rotting zooplankton carcasses.  To extract accurate information from these samples, a different set of magnification ranges were required to calculate fluxes.
