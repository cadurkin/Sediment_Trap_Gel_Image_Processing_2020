This code should be used after sorting all individual particle images into subfolders with classification labels.  
This can be done manually or using an automated classifier.

This code looks in a directory for a list of subdirectories, each labeled by particle type/class.  
The list of particle file names within each subdirectory is matched with the corresponding particle IDs in the csv file generated by Step 2.
Individual particle ID classifications are written into a separate ID column for each of the particles.
