This code performs image processing steps on gel images.  
The "Tutorial" jupyter notebook illustrates how these processing steps work on a single image example.  
Each '.py' file accesses a directory of images for each cruise.  That directory contains all images from a single magnification and the magnification must be specified.
The code is nearly the same for all cruises, but has additional processing steps for obliquely lit images.
The brightness thresholds, pixel scaling, and image dimensions were also different among the cruises.

Example of how to use in shell:

>gel_trap_image_processing [input_directory] [output_mask_directory] [magnification, an integer] [blank reference image]


The input directory is the file containing images
Output_mask_directory is the file where the code should save particle image masks and the csv data file
magnification is the microscope imaging magnification and is used to choose pixel scaling values
blank reference image is an image file that the background brightness should be normalized to.  This code could easily be modified to exclude the need for a blank reference image.

After this code has run, it will save a mask image of every micrograph so that you can sanity check the accuracy of particle detection.  
It will save a csv file with every single paritcle detected and a second csv file only including the "measured" particles (duplicates from multiple focal planes removed).
